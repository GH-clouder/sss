                 <h2><p><ul><li>Sometimes it is difficult to find the words to explain your love for someone, even if you have warm fuzzies in your heart</li>
                    <li> Say these sweet things to your girlfriend on a romantic date. These meaningful romantic words for her will definitely make her smile I love the way the light shines off of your beautiful eyes.</li>
            <li>I could stay here forever with you. No one else exists right now.</li>
            The food is delicious, but the company is even better.
            You are the perfect date. Let's hang out again every day for the rest of our lives.
            <li>I can't think of a more perfect evening... good food, a bottle of wine, and you.</li>

            <li>All day long, I've been dreaming about having this dinner with you.</li>
            <li>I don't need any dessert; I have you.
            The dinner is wonderful, but the best part is being alone with you.</li>
            <li>I don't care what's on the menu, as long as I'm looking at it with you.
            Food feeds the body, but love feeds the soul.</li>
            You're just like a fine wine... my eyes could drink you in all night.</p></h2></ol>
